Combined with image pyramid, continuous image representation of cubic B-spline curve and Parzen histogram estimation

The probability density distribution USES a Parzen histogram.Since the fixed image probability density function does not work on the derivative, smoothing is not required.Therefore, use the zero order BSpline kernel for the fixed image strength PDF.On the other hand, to ensure smoothness, use third-order BSpline.
